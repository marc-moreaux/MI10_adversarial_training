This dissertation is an original intellectual product of the author, Marc Moreaux. 

I would like to enjoy the opportunity to thank Manfred Jaeger for our discutions and his support all along this semester's thesis. I would also like to thank Iann Goodfellow for the few email we exchanged that led me to do this thesis.

This thesis is a further inversigation on adversarial-learning as refered by Iann Goodfellow and is targeting any person intersested in this thechnique applied to neural-networks.
