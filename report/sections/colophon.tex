\noindent This master thesis was written using LaTeX. The networks figures present on this report were draw with a LaTeX package called tikz. The plots, bar diagram and images were created with Matplotlib, a rendering package for Python. The simple example was fully written in Python and the broader models trained with Pylearn2. Finally most of the files are under revision control on a git repository hosted on Github.
